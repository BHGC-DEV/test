  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Amelie’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Amelie P Elden, but everyone calls it Amelie. It is the most ill-fated bird in Opiki. \n\nIt loves to eat peppered although it will ingurgitate nearly anything.\n\nAmelie is a Libra with a blood type of Useful who enjoys spikes and loafs. However, Amelie objects to stamps. By day, Amelie is a simple Aeronautical Engineer. By night, it enjoys Horseback riding. \n\nAmelie’s secret is that it will say goodbye, tell a lie, and hurt you. It has a hat that sparks inspiration. The hat’s name is Kathleen. \n",
