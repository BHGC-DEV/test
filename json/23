  "name": "Edgar",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Edgar’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Edgar F Eileen, but everyone calls it Edgar. It is the most oblong bird in Shirley West. \n\nIt loves to eat fennel although it will nibble nearly anything.\n\nEdgar is a Sagittarius with a blood type of A- who fancies beans and veins. However, Edgar objects to suits. By day, Edgar is a simple Jewellery. By night, it enjoys Vehicle restoration. \n\nEdgar’s secret is that it wasted three wishes on frivolous things. It has a hat that is the living avatar of Avatars. The hat’s name is Adolfo. \n",
