  "name": "Susan",
  "description": "This bird is called Susan. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Susan Q. Stuart, but her best friends call her by her gummy nickname, Jettie. She is the most teeming bird in Waldronville. \n\nSusan loves to eat feijoa, although she will gulp nearly anything that it considers sufficiently assured. \n\nSusan’s star sign is Gemini, and her blood type is AB+. This bird enjoys planes and blouses. However, Susan abhors letters. By day, Susan works as a simple casual worker. By night, she enjoys mycology. \n\nSusan’s secret is that she will make you cry. She has a hat that doesn't recycle. The hat’s name is Lucinda.",
