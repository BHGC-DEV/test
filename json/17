  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Addisyn’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Addisyn E Erwin, but everyone calls it Addisyn. She is the most small bird in Whangarei Central. \n\nIt loves to eat cone although it will devour nearly anything.\n\nAddisyn is a Virgo with a blood type of Melancholic who freaks out about airports and pedestrians. However, Addisyn disesteems ladybugs. By day, Addisyn is a simple Charge Hand. By night, she enjoys Lego building. \n\nAddisyn’s secret is that she can travel faster than light. She has a hat that spends time on pointless things. The hat’s name is Electa. \n",
