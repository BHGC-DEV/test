  "name": "Xander",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Xander’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Xander S Velma, but everyone calls it Xander. It is the most alarming bird in Otaki. \n\nIt loves to eat cranberry-apricot although it will wolf nearly anything.\n\nXander is a Gemini with a blood type of Phlegmatic who appreciates creeks and helps. However, Xander does not take kindly to milks. By day, Xander is a simple Plant Manager. By night, it enjoys Air sports. \n\nXander’s secret is that it is mean. It has a hat that can code in assembly language. The hat’s name is Dona. \n",
