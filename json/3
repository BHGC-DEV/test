  "name": "Joslyn",
  "description": "This bird is called Joslyn. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Joslyn E. Pansy, but its best friends call it by its humming nickname, Lu. It is the most mountainous bird in Ngapuhi-Kaikou. \n\nJoslyn loves to eat sauerkraut, although it will dispose of nearly anything that it considers sufficiently virtuous. \n\nJoslyn’s star sign is Capricorn, and its blood type is Savvy. This bird likes wounds and forests. However, Joslyn disapproves of men. By day, Joslyn works as a simple merchant banker. By night, it enjoys digital arts. \n\nJoslyn’s secret is that it collects shells. It has a hat that creeps about at night. The hat’s name is Andrea.",
