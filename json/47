  "name": "Molly",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Molly’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Molly V Gus, but everyone calls it Molly. It is the most novel bird in Inland Water-Lake Te Anau. \n\nIt loves to eat pumpkin although it will partake of nearly anything.\n\nMolly is a Pisces with a blood type of O- who fancies combs and homes. However, Molly detests gyms. By day, Molly is a simple Systems Analyst. By night, it enjoys Lockpicking. \n\nMolly’s secret is that it lives in a beehive. It has a hat that lays golden eggs. The hat’s name is Sadye. \n",
