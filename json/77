  "name": "Owen",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Owen’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Owen I Leonora, but everyone calls it Owen. It is the most forsaken bird in Linton Military Camp. \n\nIt loves to eat smelt although it will tuck into nearly anything.\n\nOwen is a Virgo with a blood type of Elf who revels in pansies and trains. However, Owen objects to theaters. By day, Owen is a simple Inventor. By night, it enjoys Dance. \n\nOwen’s secret is that it risks it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss. It has a hat that writes bestselling books about wizards before going into a very public decline. The hat’s name is Bonnie. \n",
