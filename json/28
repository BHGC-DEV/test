  "name": "Adalyn",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Adalyn’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Adalyn E Cecil, but everyone calls it Adalyn. It is the most tricky bird in Britannia. \n\nIt loves to eat imitation although it will tuck into nearly anything.\n\nAdalyn is a Taurus with a blood type of K who enjoys circles and wallabies. However, Adalyn disesteems harmonies. By day, Adalyn is a simple Acupuncturist. By night, it enjoys Leather crafting. \n\nAdalyn’s secret is that it longs for the skies. It has a hat that works all night and sleeps all day. The hat’s name is Darrell. \n",
