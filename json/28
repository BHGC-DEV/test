  "name": "Ava",
  "description": "This bird is called Ava. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Ava E. Audra, but his best friends call him by his near nickname, Gus. He is the most enchanted bird in Takapuna Central. \n\nAva loves to eat cherries, although he will dispose of nearly anything that it considers sufficiently ragged. \n\nAva’s star sign is Taurus, and his blood type is Useful. This bird rejoices in swings and snakes. However, Ava loathes peaches. By day, Ava works as a simple sports commentator. By night, he enjoys kite flying. \n\nAva’s secret is that he talks about D&D. He has a hat that is a credit to its maker. The hat’s name is Nina.",
