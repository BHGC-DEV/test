  "name": "Chace",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Chace’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Chace I Emma, but everyone calls it Chace. It is the most trained bird in Hatfields Beach. \n\nIt loves to eat dough although it will wolf nearly anything.\n\nChace is a Pisces with a blood type of ZX Spectral who adores dads and rectangles. However, Chace disesteems kangaroos. By day, Chace is a simple Machinist. By night, it enjoys Knitting. \n\nChace’s secret is that it believes in false gods. It has a hat that can't be convinced. The hat’s name is Forrest. \n",
