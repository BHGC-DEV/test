  "name": "Jace",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Jace’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Jace Y Lenna, but everyone calls it Jace. It is the most quarrelsome bird in Parnassus. \n\nIt loves to eat oopah although it will partake of nearly anything.\n\nJace is a Gemini with a blood type of Melancholic who relishes engines and machines. However, Jace does not take kindly to nights. By day, Jace is a simple Church Warden. By night, it enjoys Crocheting. \n\nJace’s secret is that it thinks this whole thing might just work somehow. It has a hat that is the living avatar of Justice. The hat’s name is Gerard. \n",
