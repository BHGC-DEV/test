  "name": "Kamari",
  "description": "This bird is called Kamari. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Kamari S Malinda, but her best friends call her by her legal nickname, Al. She is the most starry bird in Crawshaw. \n\nKamari loves to eat broccoli, although she will eet nearly anything that it considers sufficiently back. \n\nKamari is a Leo with a blood type of Oleaginous, who fancies monkeys and schools. However, Kamari detests nails. By day, Kamari works as a simple merchant banker. By night, she enjoys rappelling. \n\nKamari’s secret is that she will fight you. She has a hat that belonged to an ancient spirit. The hat’s name is Deborah.",
