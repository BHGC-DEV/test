  "name": "Kendall",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Kendall’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Kendall Q Millie, but everyone calls it Kendall. It is the most motherly bird in Highlands Park. \n\nIt loves to eat potato although it will make short work of nearly anything.\n\nKendall is a Ophiuchus with a blood type of AB- who delights in leafs and prices. However, Kendall despises seconds. By day, Kendall is a simple Art Critic. By night, it enjoys amateur radio. \n\nKendall’s secret is that it looks deep within the souls of others and sees the agony within. It has a hat that collects tiny skulls. The hat’s name is Earnest. \n",
