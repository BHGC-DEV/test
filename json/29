  "name": "Alexandra",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Alexandra’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Alexandra O Melissa, but everyone calls it Alexandra. It is the most immense bird in Otaki Forks. \n\nIt loves to eat apricot although it will chew nearly anything.\n\nAlexandra is a Aquarius with a blood type of O- who fancies necks and lines. However, Alexandra eschews knots. By day, Alexandra is a simple Astrologer. By night, it enjoys Rafting. \n\nAlexandra’s secret is that it can spell Kwisatz Haderach without needing to look it up. It has a hat that will never give you up and never let you down. The hat’s name is Pat. \n",
