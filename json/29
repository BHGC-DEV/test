  "name": "Chase",
  "description": "This bird is called Chase. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Chase Y. Guss, but its best friends call it by its submissive nickname, Marianna. It is the most sinful bird in Edmonton. \n\nChase loves to eat rocks, although it will tuck into nearly anything that it considers sufficiently constant. \n\nChase’s star sign is Virgo, and its blood type is AB-. This bird delights in fruits and recorders. However, Chase shuns kisses. By day, Chase works as a simple administration manager. By night, it enjoys kayaking. \n\nChase’s secret is that it is intelligent to the point of never knowing happiness. It has a hat that wishes it was a cat. The hat’s name is Courtney.",
