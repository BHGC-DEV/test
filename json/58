  "name": "Emerson",
  "description": "This bird is called Emerson. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Emerson S Jonas, but her best friends call her by her impure nickname, Lil. She is the most lucky bird in Mt Somers. \n\nEmerson loves to eat parsnips, although she will chew nearly anything that it considers sufficiently arid. \n\nEmerson is a Pisces with a blood type of Orc, who rejoices in valleys and foreheads. However, Emerson abhors pajamas. By day, Emerson works as a simple sales support. By night, she enjoys baseball. \n\nEmerson’s secret is that she sleeps all night and works all day. She has a hat that increases DEX by +2. The hat’s name is Opal.",
