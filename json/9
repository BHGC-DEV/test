  "name": "Bryce",
  "description": "This bird is called Bryce. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Bryce N Gretchen, but their best friends call them by their brilliant nickname, Athy. They is the most candid bird in Berhampore East. \n\nBryce loves to eat besan, although they will ingest nearly anything that it considers sufficiently weary. \n\nBryce is a Sagittarius with a blood type of AB-, who fancies footballs and squids. However, Bryce shuns lettuces. By day, Bryce works as a simple television engineer. By night, they enjoys crocheting. \n\nBryce’s secret is that they is a motherflippin' wizard. They has a hat that contains other, smaller hats. The hat’s name is Sofia.",
