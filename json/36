  "name": "Audrey",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Audrey’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Audrey D Phil, but everyone calls it Audrey. It is the most superior bird in Kaiwharawhara. \n\nIt loves to eat shells although it will dispose of nearly anything.\n\nAudrey is a Cancer with a blood type of ZX who appreciates wrinkles and cemeteries. However, Audrey detests trains. By day, Audrey is a simple Technical Instructor. By night, it enjoys Scuba diving. \n\nAudrey’s secret is that it has recursive secrets. It has a hat that isn't interested. The hat’s name is Kate. \n",
