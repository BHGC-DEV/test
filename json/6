  "name": "Orlando",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Orlando’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Orlando H Dee, but everyone calls it Orlando. It is the most repentant bird in Maungakotukutuku. \n\nIt loves to eat strudel although it will gobble nearly anything.\n\nOrlando is a Aquarius with a blood type of Oleaginous who adores sharks and cereals. However, Orlando does not take kindly to churches. By day, Orlando is a simple Chimney Sweep. By night, it enjoys Inline skating. \n\nOrlando’s secret is that it spreads butter. It has a hat that belonged to an ancient spirit. The hat’s name is Earle. \n",
