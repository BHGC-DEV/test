  "name": "Wyatt",
  "description": "This bird is called Wyatt. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Wyatt B Dannie, but its best friends call it by its well-lit nickname, Bo. It is the most unhappy bird in Broad Bay-Portobello. \n\nWyatt loves to eat knackwurst, although it will destroy nearly anything that it considers sufficiently failing. \n\nWyatt is a Sagittarius with a blood type of O-, who adores maps and fishes. However, Wyatt does not take kindly to silks. By day, Wyatt works as a simple classroom aide. By night, it enjoys sand art. \n\nWyatt’s secret is that it wants to put a dent in the world. It has a hat that sighs too loudly. The hat’s name is Marian.",
