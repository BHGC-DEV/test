  "name": "Ingrid",
  "description": "This bird is called Ingrid. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Ingrid T. Tiny, but its best friends call it by its writhing nickname, Vester. It is the most little bird in Richmond North. \n\nIngrid loves to eat butter, although it will ingurgitate nearly anything that it considers sufficiently open. \n\nIngrid’s star sign is Sagittarius, and its blood type is ZX Spectral. This bird goes crazy for glasses and lunches. However, Ingrid disesteems rowboats. By day, Ingrid works as a simple smallholder. By night, it enjoys puzzles. \n\nIngrid’s secret is that it has an untouched video game backlog stretching back to 2005. It has a hat that screams and screams and screams and screams. The hat’s name is Magdalene.",
