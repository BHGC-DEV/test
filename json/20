  "name": "Ellen",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Ellen’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Ellen D Delphine, but everyone calls it Ellen. It is the most spherical bird in Pacific View. \n\nIt loves to eat celery although it will destroy nearly anything.\n\nEllen is a Leo with a blood type of A- who likes banks and boys. However, Ellen loathes colleges. By day, Ellen is a simple Mechanic. By night, it enjoys Skimboarding. \n\nEllen’s secret is that it yawns bigly. It has a hat that can sing, but only songs you hate. The hat’s name is Alva. \n",
