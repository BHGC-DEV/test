  "name": "Aldo",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Aldo’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Aldo W Adela, but everyone calls it Aldo. It is the most limp bird in Otumoetai North. \n\nIt loves to eat ginger although it will partake of nearly anything.\n\nAldo is a Ophiuchus with a blood type of AB- who appreciates bites and crops. However, Aldo is averse to gyms. By day, Aldo is a simple Employment. By night, it enjoys Baseball. \n\nAldo’s secret is that it disappoints. It has a hat that has walked five thousand miles and will walk five thousand more. The hat’s name is Lera. \n",
