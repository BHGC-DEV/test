  "name": "Zackery",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Zackery’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Zackery [ Esco, but everyone calls it Zackery. It is the most caring bird in Oriental Bay. \n\nIt loves to eat refried beans although it will inhale nearly anything.\n\nZackery is a Libra with a blood type of O+ who enjoys stomachs and hats. However, Zackery objects to lands. By day, Zackery is a simple Art Historian. By night, it enjoys Singing. \n\nZackery’s secret is that it searches without stopping. It has a hat that serves the One True God. The hat’s name is Irma. \n",
