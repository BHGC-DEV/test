  "name": "Rodolfo",
  "description": "This bird is called Rodolfo. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Rodolfo Z. Helena, but his best friends call him by his boring nickname, Gertrude. He is the most amusing bird in Resolution. \n\nRodolfo loves to eat watercress, although he will chaw nearly anything that it considers sufficiently vigorous. \n\nRodolfo’s star sign is Pisces, and his blood type is AB-. This bird goes crazy for islands and pansies. However, Rodolfo abhors thoughts. By day, Rodolfo works as a simple baptist minister. By night, he enjoys taxidermy. \n\nRodolfo’s secret is that he is actually Canadian. He has a hat that has recursive secrets. The hat’s name is Rolla.",
