  "description": "This bird is called King. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is King D Hassie, but their best friends call them by their jolly nickname, Del. They is the most agitated bird in Sandymount. \n\nKing loves to eat candies, although they will polish off nearly anything that it considers sufficiently foolish. \n\nKing is a Cancer with a blood type of A-, who freaks out about swallows and CDs. However, King does not take kindly to grills. By day, King works as a simple horticultural consultant. By night, they enjoys magic. \n\nKing’s secret is that they virtue signals. They has a hat that is the living avatar of Truth. The hat’s name is Dennis.",
