  "name": "Layton",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Layton’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Layton H Rita, but everyone calls it Layton. It is the most quintessential bird in Parakai Urban. \n\nIt loves to eat pickle although it will scoff nearly anything.\n\nLayton is a Gemini with a blood type of Savvy who relishes doors and fuels. However, Layton shuns courts. By day, Layton is a simple Tax Advisor. By night, it enjoys Bodybuilding. \n\nLayton’s secret is that it recycles assiduously. It has a hat that spreads woe. The hat’s name is Elvira. \n",
