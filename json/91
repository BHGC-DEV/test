  "name": "Cassidy",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Cassidy’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Cassidy N Reynolds, but everyone calls it Cassidy. She is the most famous bird in Tinwald. \n\nIt loves to eat danish although it will munch nearly anything.\n\nCassidy is a Pisces with a blood type of Sanguine who revels in questions and months. However, Cassidy eschews pets. By day, Cassidy is a simple Forester. By night, she enjoys Macrame. \n\nCassidy’s secret is that she has boring kinks. She has a hat that rules. The hat’s name is Corda. \n",
