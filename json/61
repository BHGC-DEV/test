  "name": "Josiah",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Josiah’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Josiah Z Tina, but everyone calls it Josiah. It is the most frilly bird in Papakura South. \n\nIt loves to eat grass although it will nibble nearly anything.\n\nJosiah is a Aquarius with a blood type of Elf who fancies strangers and foxes. However, Josiah despises coffees. By day, Josiah is a simple Stable Hand. By night, it enjoys Netball. \n\nJosiah’s secret is that it only has correct opinions. It has a hat that is a lumberjack and is OK. The hat’s name is Lois. \n",
