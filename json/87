  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Aldo’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Aldo M Leontine, but everyone calls it Aldo. It is the most utilized bird in Ngauranga West. \n\nIt loves to eat salmonberries although it will eat nearly anything.\n\nAldo is a Virgo with a blood type of Yaas who freaks out about rewards and crops. However, Aldo does not take kindly to pastries. By day, Aldo is a simple Literary Agent. By night, it enjoys Mountaineering. \n\nAldo’s secret is that it taps along to the beat of the music. It has a hat that cannot keep secrets. The hat’s name is Mamie. \n",
