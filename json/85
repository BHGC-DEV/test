  "name": "Britney",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Britney’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Britney L Alfreda, but everyone calls it Britney. She is the most nice bird in Murchison. \n\nIt loves to eat wheat although it will inhale nearly anything.\n\nBritney is a Aquarius with a blood type of Dark Red who freaks out about streams and fountains. However, Britney objects to stems. By day, Britney is a simple Quality Inspector. By night, she enjoys Sand art. \n\nBritney’s secret is that she can fly at more than 400 mph. She has a hat that causes excessive yawning. The hat’s name is Susie. \n",
