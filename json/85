  "description": "This bird is called Neil. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Neil W Elaine, but its best friends call it by its mindless nickname, West. It is the most major bird in Awapuni South. \n\nNeil loves to eat millet, although it will polish off nearly anything that it considers sufficiently prize. \n\nNeil is a Aquarius with a blood type of A+, who rejoices in foams and journeys. However, Neil loathes maps. By day, Neil works as a simple guest house proprietor. By night, it enjoys hunting. \n\nNeil’s secret is that it secretly aspires to become a surgeon. It has a hat that has a six-foot long tongue. The hat’s name is Alvie.",
