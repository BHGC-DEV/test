  "name": "Reed",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Reed’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Reed R Isaac, but everyone calls it Reed. He is the most tame bird in Rototuna. \n\nIt loves to eat apricots although it will munch nearly anything.\n\nReed is a Scorpio with a blood type of AB+ who adores alarms and diets. However, Reed antipathizes volleyballs. By day, Reed is a simple Administration Assistant. By night, he enjoys Paintball. \n\nReed’s secret is that he is into crypto. He has a hat that has incorrect opinions. The hat’s name is Leona. \n",
