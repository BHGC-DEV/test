  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Alec’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Alec A Alden, but everyone calls it Alec. He is the most untidy bird in Oceanic-Northland Region. \n\nIt loves to eat tamarinds although it will finish nearly anything.\n\nAlec is a Cancer with a blood type of Dark Red who relishes nights and beavers. However, Alec objects to curves. By day, Alec is a simple Payroll Supervisor. By night, he enjoys Sketching. \n\nAlec’s secret is that he has an untouched videogame backlog stretching back to 2005. He has a hat that can't sing. The hat’s name is Dexter. \n",
