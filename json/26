  "name": "Hugh",
  "description": "This bird is called Hugh. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Hugh V. Mallie, but his best friends call him by his putrid nickname, Clement. He is the most silent bird in Barrett. \n\nHugh loves to eat baby food, although he will put away nearly anything that it considers sufficiently minty. \n\nHugh’s star sign is Scorpio, and his blood type is O-. This bird freaks out about keys and furs. However, Hugh dislikes menus. By day, Hugh works as a simple youth worker. By night, he enjoys lacemaking. \n\nHugh’s secret is that he drinks milk from the source. He has a hat that doesn't stop, never gives up, holds its head high and reaches the top. The hat’s name is Carmel.",
