  "name": "Jamir",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Jamir’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Jamir E Artie, but everyone calls it Jamir. It is the most international bird in Tauhoa-Puhoi. \n\nIt loves to eat maraschino although it will tuck into nearly anything.\n\nJamir is a Ophiuchus with a blood type of AB+ who enjoys ankles and hamsters. However, Jamir objects to pens. By day, Jamir is a simple Servant. By night, it enjoys Swimming. \n\nJamir’s secret is that it doesn't stop, never gives up, holds its head high and reaches the top. It has a hat that is more than the sum of its parts. The hat’s name is Hosie. \n",
