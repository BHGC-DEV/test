  "name": "Gaige",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Gaige’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Gaige G Corene, but everyone calls it Gaige. It is the most bubbly bird in Tokorangi-Hiwinui. \n\nIt loves to eat shells although it will obliterate nearly anything.\n\nGaige is a Aries with a blood type of AB+ who adores hips and kites. However, Gaige scorns answers. By day, Gaige is a simple Inventor. By night, it enjoys Cabaret. \n\nGaige’s secret is that it didn't bring a coat. It has a hat that enjoys spreadsheets. The hat’s name is Margie. \n",
