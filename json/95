  "name": "Brock",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Brock’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Brock J Monroe, but everyone calls it Brock. It is the most required bird in Palmerston. \n\nIt loves to eat cockles although it will annihilate nearly anything.\n\nBrock is a Pisces with a blood type of Biff who revels in surprises and theaters. However, Brock antipathizes grapes. By day, Brock is a simple Technical Co-ordinator. By night, it enjoys Scuba diving. \n\nBrock’s secret is that it believes false facts. It has a hat that can roll into a ball. The hat’s name is Kelley. \n",
