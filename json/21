  "name": "Shannon",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Shannon’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Shannon H Alfreda, but everyone calls it Shannon. It is the most self-assured bird in Tawa Central. \n\nIt loves to eat dishes although it will scoff nearly anything.\n\nShannon is a Ophiuchus with a blood type of Savvy who appreciates slopes and dragonflies. However, Shannon dislikes silks. By day, Shannon is a simple Nursing Auxiliary. By night, it enjoys Taekwondo. \n\nShannon’s secret is that it yeets. It has a hat that doesn't care. The hat’s name is Angie. \n",
