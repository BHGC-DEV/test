  "name": "Casey",
  "description": "This bird is called Casey. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Casey D. Reva, but his best friends call him by his oval nickname, Eliza. He is the most melodic bird in Buckland South. \n\nCasey loves to eat purslane, although he will nibble nearly anything that it considers sufficiently rare. \n\nCasey’s star sign is Aquarius, and his blood type is Phlegmatic. This bird freaks out about caterpillars and bulldozers. However, Casey dislikes mechanics. By day, Casey works as a simple purchasing assistant. By night, he enjoys scouting. \n\nCasey’s secret is that he yeets. He has a hat that eats bees. The hat’s name is Chas.",
