  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Jewel’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Jewel X Theresia, but everyone calls it Jewel. It is the most agonizing bird in Bruce Bay-Paringa. \n\nIt loves to eat puree although it will nyam nearly anything.\n\nJewel is a Capricorn with a blood type of Wizard who rejoices in karats and steps. However, Jewel disapproves of cellos. By day, Jewel is a simple Hospital Worker. By night, it enjoys Gardening. \n\nJewel’s secret is that it has been there and back again. It has a hat that serves a false god. The hat’s name is Zoe. \n",
