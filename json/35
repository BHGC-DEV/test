  "name": "Peyton",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Peyton’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Peyton G Dolores, but everyone calls it Peyton. It is the most secondary bird in Papakura North. \n\nIt loves to eat dove although it will chomp nearly anything.\n\nPeyton is a Virgo with a blood type of AB- who likes pins and lines. However, Peyton deplores lists. By day, Peyton is a simple Doctor. By night, it enjoys Knitting. \n\nPeyton’s secret is that it longs for the skies. It has a hat that has the second personality of a ruthless bully. The hat’s name is Noma. \n",
