  "name": "Kayley",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Kayley’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Kayley A Loretta, but everyone calls it Kayley. It is the most lumbering bird in Nireaha-Tiraumea. \n\nIt loves to eat toppings although it will partake of nearly anything.\n\nKayley is a Aquarius with a blood type of Zoinks who delights in clarinets and carrots. However, Kayley antipathizes twigs. By day, Kayley is a simple Bingo Caller. By night, it enjoys Knitting. \n\nKayley’s secret is that it is assembling a small low-yield nuclear device. It has a hat that screams and screams and screams and screams. The hat’s name is Carmella. \n",
