  "name": "Lilah",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Lilah’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Lilah T Arline, but everyone calls it Lilah. It is the most sane bird in Halswell Domain. \n\nIt loves to eat watercress although it will dispose of nearly anything.\n\nLilah is a Virgo with a blood type of Retiring who appreciates lemonades and groups. However, Lilah objects to policemen. By day, Lilah is a simple Advertising Executive. By night, it enjoys Soapmaking. \n\nLilah’s secret is that it is the best bird. It has a hat that is assembling a small low-yield nuclear device. The hat’s name is Alexander. \n",
