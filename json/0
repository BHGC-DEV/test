  "name": "Karen",
  "description": "This bird is called Karen. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Karen T Lida, but her best friends call her by her turbulent nickname, Tony. She is the most adventurous bird in Westbrook. \n\nKaren loves to eat ready-to-drink fluids, although she will demolish nearly anything that it considers sufficiently grounded. \n\nKaren is a Libra with a blood type of A-, who relishes cicadas and pails. However, Karen objects to feet. By day, Karen works as a simple road worker. By night, she enjoys quilting. \n\nKaren’s secret is that she says \"eyyyyy\". She has a hat that drops sick beats. The hat’s name is Marcel.",
