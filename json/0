  "name": "Amara",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Amara’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Amara Y Joesph, but everyone calls it Amara. It is the most crisp bird in Levin South. \n\nIt loves to eat breadfruit although it will annihilate nearly anything.\n\nAmara is a Virgo with a blood type of Biff who enjoys curtains and backbones. However, Amara disesteems peanuts. By day, Amara is a simple Instructor. By night, it enjoys Paintball. \n\nAmara’s secret is that it wishes it was somewhere else. It has a hat that can moo. The hat’s name is Dexter. \n",
