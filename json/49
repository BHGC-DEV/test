  "name": "Darrell",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Darrell’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Darrell Y Alfredo, but everyone calls it Darrell. He is the most familiar bird in Mangaroa. \n\nIt loves to eat seeds although it will finish nearly anything.\n\nDarrell is a Taurus with a blood type of ZX Spectral who likes ears and stopwatches. However, Darrell disapproves of shelves. By day, Darrell is a simple Trade Union Official. By night, he enjoys Water sports. \n\nDarrell’s secret is that he is much too heavy. He has a hat that is mean. The hat’s name is Mabelle. \n",
