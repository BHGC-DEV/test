  "name": "Ethan",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Ethan’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Ethan K Viola, but everyone calls it Ethan. It is the most lined bird in Mairtown. \n\nIt loves to eat croissants although it will devour nearly anything.\n\nEthan is a Leo with a blood type of Retiring who rejoices in forks and pizzas. However, Ethan antipathizes knots. By day, Ethan is a simple Butcher. By night, it enjoys Scouting. \n\nEthan’s secret is that it longs to burrow underground. It has a hat that strains the ocean for krill with a mouth full of baleen. The hat’s name is Joe. \n",
