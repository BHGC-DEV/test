  "name": "Alex",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Alex’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Alex L Alyce, but everyone calls it Alex. It is the most oily bird in Hillmorton. \n\nIt loves to eat sesbania although it will partake of nearly anything.\n\nAlex is a Pisces with a blood type of A+ who appreciates ants and breakfasts. However, Alex shuns stopwatches. By day, Alex is a simple Laboratory Analyst. By night, it enjoys Glassblowing. \n\nAlex’s secret is that it is always on time. It has a hat that can't concentrate. The hat’s name is Euna. \n",
