  "name": "Azaria",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Azaria’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Azaria O Mollie, but everyone calls it Azaria. It is the most sad bird in Inland Water-Lake Rotorua. \n\nIt loves to eat quarters although it will eat nearly anything.\n\nAzaria is a Pisces with a blood type of ZX Spectral who fancies litters and cups. However, Azaria scorns cloths. By day, Azaria is a simple Plant Operator. By night, it enjoys Slacklining. \n\nAzaria’s secret is that it wasted three wishes on frivolous things. It has a hat that has walked five thousand miles and will walk five thousand more. The hat’s name is Kirk. \n",
