  "name": "Erin",
  "description": "This bird is called Erin. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Erin O Archibald, but its best friends call it by its inexperienced nickname, Rose. It is the most occasional bird in Kelburn. \n\nErin loves to eat gourds, although it will make short work of nearly anything that it considers sufficiently muddy. \n\nErin is a Aquarius with a blood type of AB+, who adores milkshakes and magics. However, Erin shuns jackets. By day, Erin works as a simple highway inspector. By night, it enjoys sewing. \n\nErin’s secret is that it longs for the skies. It has a hat that has walked five thousand miles and won't walk a step more. The hat’s name is Regis.",
