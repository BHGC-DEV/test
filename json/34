  "name": "Kimberly",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Kimberly’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Kimberly K Pattie, but everyone calls it Kimberly. It is the most fresh bird in Owhango. \n\nIt loves to eat swisswurst although it will destroy nearly anything.\n\nKimberly is a Taurus with a blood type of A- who fancies teachers and yards. However, Kimberly avoids dances. By day, Kimberly is a simple Cleric. By night, it enjoys Calligraphy. \n\nKimberly’s secret is that it is stronger than the foundations of the earth. It has a hat that cares. The hat’s name is Loretta. \n",
