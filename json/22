  "name": "Turner",
  "description": "This bird is called Turner. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Turner Y. Gwen, but her best friends call her by her faint nickname, Bree. She is the most favorable bird in Poets Block. \n\nTurner loves to eat gelatin, although she will nyam nearly anything that it considers sufficiently spirited. \n\nTurner’s star sign is Cancer, and her blood type is Melancholic. This bird adores dressers and pamphlets. However, Turner despises lists. By day, Turner works as a simple mechanic. By night, she enjoys glassblowing. \n\nTurner’s secret is that she has powers that could shatter the foundations of the earth. She has a hat that treats retail workers well. The hat’s name is Chalmer.",
