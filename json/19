  "name": "Mollie",
  "description": "This bird is called Mollie. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Mollie J. Allean, but her best friends call her by her darling nickname, Zadock. She is the most acrobatic bird in Cockle Bay. \n\nMollie loves to eat yambeans, although she will eet nearly anything that it considers sufficiently Spanish. \n\nMollie’s star sign is Aquarius, and her blood type is Phlegmatic. This bird goes crazy for relativess and mouths. However, Mollie despises windscreens. By day, Mollie works as a simple locum pharmacist. By night, she enjoys foraging. \n\nMollie’s secret is that she enjoys spreadsheets. She has a hat that messes around in boats. The hat’s name is Ora.",
