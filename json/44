  "name": "Kellen",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Kellen’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Kellen J Hollis, but everyone calls it Kellen. It is the most glamorous bird in Waldronville. \n\nIt loves to eat redditors although it will ingest nearly anything.\n\nKellen is a Gemini with a blood type of Zoinks who delights in cottons and icicles. However, Kellen dislikes steps. By day, Kellen is a simple Military Leader. By night, it enjoys Book restoration. \n\nKellen’s secret is that it disdains birdseed. It has a hat that is a credit to its maker. The hat’s name is Theadore. \n",
