  "name": "Madilynn",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Madilynn’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Madilynn A Maye, but everyone calls it Madilynn. It is the most inferior bird in Glen Innes East. \n\nIt loves to eat raab although it will chow down nearly anything.\n\nMadilynn is a Scorpio with a blood type of Retiring who revels in plantations and trousers. However, Madilynn deplores shoemakers. By day, Madilynn is a simple Song Writer. By night, it enjoys Pottery. \n\nMadilynn’s secret is that it is too good. It has a hat that doesn't tip. The hat’s name is Dolly. \n",
