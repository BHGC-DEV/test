  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Ashlyn’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Ashlyn F General, but everyone calls it Ashlyn. It is the most French bird in Pakuranga North. \n\nIt loves to eat clementines although it will chaw nearly anything.\n\nAshlyn is a Pisces with a blood type of Zoinks who likes tunas and rectangles. However, Ashlyn detests men. By day, Ashlyn is a simple Sales Assistant. By night, it enjoys Watching movies. \n\nAshlyn’s secret is that it is never gonna tell a lie and hurt you. It has a hat that sparks fear. The hat’s name is Marietta. \n",
