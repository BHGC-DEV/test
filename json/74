  "name": "Keira",
  "description": "This bird is called Keira. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Keira E Loren, but its best friends call it by its stupid nickname, Liley. It is the most pastel bird in Mt Wellington North. \n\nKeira loves to eat venison, although it will tuck into nearly anything that it considers sufficiently improbable. \n\nKeira is a Ophiuchus with a blood type of A+, who fancies inks and dragons. However, Keira dislikes weapons. By day, Keira works as a simple mechanic. By night, it enjoys running. \n\nKeira’s secret is that it searches without stopping. It has a hat that is searching for a heart of gold. The hat’s name is Ola.",
