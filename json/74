  "name": "Russell",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Russell’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Russell O Florence, but everyone calls it Russell. It is the most winged bird in Waiuku East. \n\nIt loves to eat fish although it will eet nearly anything.\n\nRussell is a Pisces with a blood type of Bold who appreciates aardvarks and heats. However, Russell deplores pastes. By day, Russell is a simple Glass Worker. By night, it enjoys Jogging. \n\nRussell’s secret is that it tells its secrets to everyone so they're no longer secret, are they. It has a hat that increases INT by +4. The hat’s name is Ophelia. \n",
