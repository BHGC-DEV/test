  "name": "Clay",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Clay’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Clay Y Lela, but everyone calls it Clay. He is the most prestigious bird in Highlands Park. \n\nIt loves to eat borage although it will devour nearly anything.\n\nClay is a Cancer with a blood type of Zoinks who revels in silvers and kicks. However, Clay deplores wishes. By day, Clay is a simple Window Dresser. By night, he enjoys Mountaineering. \n\nClay’s secret is that he trusts the Free Market to sort everything out. He has a hat that causes excessive yawning. The hat’s name is Doyle. \n",
