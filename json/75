  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Ruby’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Ruby C Bert, but everyone calls it Ruby. She is the most conscious bird in Springvale West. \n\nIt loves to eat edamame although it will polish off nearly anything.\n\nRuby is a Pisces with a blood type of Choleric who revels in words and trails. However, Ruby despises Internets. By day, Ruby is a simple Lighting Designer. By night, she enjoys Mountaineering. \n\nRuby’s secret is that she longs to burrow underground. She has a hat that cares for plants. The hat’s name is Ted. \n",
