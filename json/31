  "name": "Brenden",
  "description": "This bird is called Brenden. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Brenden C Sibyl, but his best friends call him by his speedy nickname, Gertrude. He is the most untidy bird in Hospital Hill. \n\nBrenden loves to eat hydrolyzed cats, although he will chaw nearly anything that it considers sufficiently suspicious. \n\nBrenden is a Gemini with a blood type of O-, who relishes dryers and creams. However, Brenden dislikes chickens. By day, Brenden works as a simple stationer. By night, he enjoys hooping. \n\nBrenden’s secret is that he is never gonna run around and desert you. He has a hat that hangs around in bars. The hat’s name is Dexter.",
