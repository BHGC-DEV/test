  "name": "Sebastian",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Sebastian’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Sebastian U Odelia, but everyone calls it Sebastian. It is the most harmless bird in Mt Wellington Domain. \n\nIt loves to eat tomatoes although it will partake of nearly anything.\n\nSebastian is a Aquarius with a blood type of Elf who likes nails and bags. However, Sebastian dislikes words. By day, Sebastian is a simple Scaffolder. By night, it enjoys Embroidery. \n\nSebastian’s secret is that it gets distracted easily. It has a hat that has achieved enlightenment. The hat’s name is Wyatt. \n",
