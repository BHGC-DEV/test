  "name": "Cade",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Cade’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Cade L Cleo, but everyone calls it Cade. It is the most virtuous bird in Manunui. \n\nIt loves to eat nance although it will snack nearly anything.\n\nCade is a Pisces with a blood type of Halfling who appreciates sides and medicines. However, Cade loathes hardware. By day, Cade is a simple Recruitment Consultant. By night, it enjoys Mountaineering. \n\nCade’s secret is that it is just going through the motions. It has a hat that is stronger than the foundations of the earth. The hat’s name is Jimmie. \n",
