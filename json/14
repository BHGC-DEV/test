  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Essence’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Essence C Bruce, but everyone calls it Essence. It is the most warmhearted bird in Parnell West. \n\nIt loves to eat bagel although it will swallow nearly anything.\n\nEssence is a Pisces with a blood type of Wizard who likes asparaguses and knights. However, Essence detests cartoons. By day, Essence is a simple Postwoman. By night, it enjoys Polo. \n\nEssence’s secret is that it is a simp for cats. It has a hat that knows you better than you know yourself. The hat’s name is Iva. \n",
