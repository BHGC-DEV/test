  "name": "Cassandra",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Cassandra’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Cassandra E Clifford, but everyone calls it Cassandra. It is the most bulky bird in Roseneath. \n\nIt loves to eat flavored although it will get stuck into nearly anything.\n\nCassandra is a Scorpio with a blood type of Yaas who rejoices in sheep and ladybugs. However, Cassandra avoids magicians. By day, Cassandra is a simple Marketing Director. By night, it enjoys Fashion. \n\nCassandra’s secret is that it is the Dark Lord of all it surveys. It has a hat that owns several rental properties which are poorly maintained. The hat’s name is Theodora. \n",
