  "name": "Victoria",
  "description": "This bird is called Victoria. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Victoria Z. Hunter, but her best friends call her by her velvety nickname, Ry. She is the most necessary bird in Mcleod. \n\nVictoria loves to eat cockles, although she will annihilate nearly anything that it considers sufficiently interesting. \n\nVictoria’s star sign is Leo, and her blood type is O-. This bird adores pies and messages. However, Victoria antipathizes collars. By day, Victoria works as a simple letting agent. By night, she enjoys lacemaking. \n\nVictoria’s secret is that she is an enormous chad. She has a hat that Is sadly a Canadian. The hat’s name is Green.",
