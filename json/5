  "name": "Martha",
  "description": "This bird is called Martha. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Martha P Luvenia, but its best friends call it by its handy nickname, Wil. It is the most nutty bird in Omata. \n\nMartha loves to eat pea, although it will chew nearly anything that it considers sufficiently idle. \n\nMartha is a Sagittarius with a blood type of O-, who relishes pansies and sandwiches. However, Martha does not take kindly to banks. By day, Martha works as a simple underwriter. By night, it enjoys skimboarding. \n\nMartha’s secret is that it spreads disinformation. It has a hat that is a different colour from the colour it appears to be. The hat’s name is Loren.",
