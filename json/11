  "name": "Mekhi",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Mekhi’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Mekhi H Amie, but everyone calls it Mekhi. It is the most repulsive bird in New Lynn North. \n\nIt loves to eat weed although it will gulp nearly anything.\n\nMekhi is a Virgo with a blood type of Halfling who delights in horns and planes. However, Mekhi loathes names. By day, Mekhi is a simple Pipe Inspector. By night, it enjoys Rock climbing. \n\nMekhi’s secret is that it is a Boomer. It has a hat that tips generously. The hat’s name is Serena. \n",
