  "name": "Alicia",
  "description": "This bird is called Alicia. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Alicia L. Courtland, but its best friends call it by its homely nickname, Freddie. It is the most piercing bird in Happy Valley-Owhiro Bay. \n\nAlicia loves to eat volteados, although it will dispose of nearly anything that it considers sufficiently coarse. \n\nAlicia’s star sign is Sagittarius, and its blood type is B+. This bird fancies sons and locks. However, Alicia loathes cottons. By day, Alicia works as a simple audit clerk. By night, it enjoys singing. \n\nAlicia’s secret is that it can spell Kwisatz Haderach without needing to look it up. It has a hat that thinks the series peaked with Season 7. The hat’s name is Alf.",
