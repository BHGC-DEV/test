  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Bria’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Bria D Elwood, but everyone calls it Bria. It is the most whimsical bird in Vinetown. \n\nIt loves to eat grapefruit although it will chow down nearly anything.\n\nBria is a Capricorn with a blood type of Bold who adores bats and energies. However, Bria disapproves of fishes. By day, Bria is a simple Telephonist. By night, it enjoys Fishing. \n\nBria’s secret is that it is a lumberjack. It has a hat that is a motherflippin' wizard. The hat’s name is Lawerence. \n",
