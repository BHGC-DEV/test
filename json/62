  "name": "Keely",
  "description": "This bird is called Keely. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Keely I Rollin, but her best friends call her by her double nickname, Mur. She is the most bitter bird in Rongotea. \n\nKeely loves to eat bees, although she will gulp nearly anything that it considers sufficiently high. \n\nKeely is a Ophiuchus with a blood type of B+, who rejoices in straws and shops. However, Keely deplores faces. By day, Keely works as a simple youth worker. By night, she enjoys sculpting. \n\nKeely’s secret is that she talks about D&D. She has a hat that it can never remove. The hat’s name is Booker.",
