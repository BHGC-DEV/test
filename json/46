  "name": "Lincoln",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Lincoln’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Lincoln [ Curtis, but everyone calls it Lincoln. It is the most clueless bird in Te Kuiti. \n\nIt loves to eat cilantro although it will nyam nearly anything.\n\nLincoln is a Pisces with a blood type of B- who relishes dogs and zebras. However, Lincoln objects to beaches. By day, Lincoln is a simple Violinist. By night, it enjoys Hiking. \n\nLincoln’s secret is that it thinks the series peaked with Season 7. It has a hat that doesn't think things through. The hat’s name is Jonnie. \n",
