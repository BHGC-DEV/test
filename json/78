  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Diamond’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Diamond H Novella, but everyone calls it Diamond. It is the most gross bird in Allenton West. \n\nIt loves to eat pork although it will dispose of nearly anything.\n\nDiamond is a Cancer with a blood type of AB- who likes buss and sinks. However, Diamond avoids stopwatches. By day, Diamond is a simple Beautician. By night, it enjoys Fashion. \n\nDiamond’s secret is that it doesn't use Oxford commas. It has a hat that blows. The hat’s name is Vella. \n",
