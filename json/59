  "name": "Miriam",
  "description": "This bird is called Miriam. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Miriam X Alex, but her best friends call her by her pleasant nickname, Theodore. She is the most forsaken bird in Bremner. \n\nMiriam loves to eat fast, although she will munch nearly anything that it considers sufficiently snoopy. \n\nMiriam is a Leo with a blood type of B-, who adores queens and crops. However, Miriam shuns grapes. By day, Miriam works as a simple marine electrician. By night, she enjoys crocheting. \n\nMiriam’s secret is that she will outlast us all. She has a hat that cannot keep secrets. The hat’s name is Craig.",
