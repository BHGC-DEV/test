  "name": "Annie",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Annie’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Annie Z Donnie, but everyone calls it Annie. It is the most gaseous bird in Fairhall. \n\nIt loves to eat durian although it will wolf nearly anything.\n\nAnnie is a Sagittarius with a blood type of ZX who relishes umbrellas and CDs. However, Annie abhors golfs. By day, Annie is a simple Hotel Worker. By night, it enjoys Stand-up comedy. \n\nAnnie’s secret is that it stays too long. It has a hat that has an appetite for creation. The hat’s name is Ethyl. \n",
