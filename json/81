  "name": "Sidney",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Sidney’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Sidney X Alvena, but everyone calls it Sidney. It is the most curvy bird in Harbourside. \n\nIt loves to eat shallots although it will gobble nearly anything.\n\nSidney is a Ophiuchus with a blood type of Biff who likes men and lilies. However, Sidney does not take kindly to pockets. By day, Sidney is a simple Granite Technician. By night, it enjoys Taekwondo. \n\nSidney’s secret is that it looks at cat pictures on the internet. It has a hat that is nice. The hat’s name is Marion. \n",
