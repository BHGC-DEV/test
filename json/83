  "name": "Zackary",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Zackary’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Zackary I Earlie, but everyone calls it Zackary. It is the most tricky bird in Avondale West. \n\nIt loves to eat refried beans although it will tuck into nearly anything.\n\nZackary is a Leo with a blood type of Melancholic who rejoices in motorboats and dishes. However, Zackary disesteems beasts. By day, Zackary is a simple Janitor. By night, it enjoys Kite flying. \n\nZackary’s secret is that it owns property. It has a hat that was once highly fashionable. The hat’s name is Lavada. \n",
