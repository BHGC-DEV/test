  "name": "Cole",
  "description": "This bird is called Cole. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Cole Q Emeline, but its best friends call it by its vivacious nickname, Chester. It is the most boiling bird in Glenview. \n\nCole loves to eat toast, although it will devour nearly anything that it considers sufficiently imperturbable. \n\nCole is a Capricorn with a blood type of AB-, who likes countries and moons. However, Cole disesteems goals. By day, Cole works as a simple magistrates clerk. By night, it enjoys cycling. \n\nCole’s secret is that it believes in false gods. It has a hat that thinks this whole thing might just work somehow. The hat’s name is Thomas.",
