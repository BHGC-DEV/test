  "name": "Zion",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Zion’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Zion C Hester, but everyone calls it Zion. It is the most apprehensive bird in Maniototo. \n\nIt loves to eat ascidians although it will demolish nearly anything.\n\nZion is a Virgo with a blood type of Dark Red who revels in stools and workshops. However, Zion abhors potatoes. By day, Zion is a simple Radiologist. By night, it enjoys Astronomy. \n\nZion’s secret is that it eats too much. It has a hat that talks about D&D. The hat’s name is Hazen. \n",
