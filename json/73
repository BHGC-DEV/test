  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Kaydence’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Kaydence O Elvera, but everyone calls it Kaydence. She is the most prudent bird in Pencarrow. \n\nIt loves to eat meatloaf although it will eat nearly anything.\n\nKaydence is a Virgo with a blood type of O- who rejoices in hyenas and weapons. However, Kaydence disesteems evenings. By day, Kaydence is a simple Homecare Manager. By night, she enjoys Water sports. \n\nKaydence’s secret is that she works all night and sleeps all day. She has a hat that it can never remove. The hat’s name is Elfrieda. \n",
