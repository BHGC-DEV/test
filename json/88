  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Amare’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Amare I Ellie, but everyone calls it Amare. He is the most better bird in One Tree Hill East. \n\nIt loves to eat bean although it will nibble nearly anything.\n\nAmare is a Cancer with a blood type of Orc who appreciates cats and trousers. However, Amare does not take kindly to chins. By day, Amare is a simple Storeman. By night, he enjoys 3D printing. \n\nAmare’s secret is that he doesn't bathe. He has a hat that has multiple sockpuppet accounts. The hat’s name is Charley. \n",
