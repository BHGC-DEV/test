  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Amir’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Amir A Fritz, but everyone calls it Amir. It is the most joyful bird in Karori South. \n\nIt loves to eat purslane although it will ingest nearly anything.\n\nAmir is a Leo with a blood type of Phlegmatic who adores squids and houses. However, Amir dislikes pansies. By day, Amir is a simple Tug Skipper. By night, it enjoys Knapping. \n\nAmir’s secret is that it spreads conspiracies. It has a hat that will run around and desert you. The hat’s name is Rubye. \n",
