  "name": "Fisher",
  "description": "This bird is called Fisher. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Fisher S Pate, but its best friends call it by its watery nickname, Tempy. It is the most unsightly bird in St Lukes North. \n\nFisher loves to eat peppered, although it will consume nearly anything that it considers sufficiently guilty. \n\nFisher is a Leo with a blood type of AB-, who appreciates boards and kisses. However, Fisher antipathizes swallows. By day, Fisher works as a simple civil engineer. By night, it enjoys stand-up comedy. \n\nFisher’s secret is that it the chaddiest chad that ever chadded. It has a hat that will give you up and let you down. The hat’s name is Golda.",
