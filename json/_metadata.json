It is the most dirty bird in Oceanic-Southland Region. \n\nIt loves to eat dessert although it will destroy nearly anything.\n\nImmanuel is a Aquarius with a blood type of Oleaginous who relishes balloons and cabbages. However, Immanuel loathes wrenches. By day, Immanuel is a simple Immigration Officer. By night, it enjoys Soapmaking. \n\nImmanuel’s secret is that it sets small fires. It has a hat that plays the guitar but only the same three songs that it learned as a teenager. The hat’s name is Lloyd. \n",
