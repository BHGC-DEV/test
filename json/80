  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Misael’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Misael Z Berenice, but everyone calls it Misael. It is the most cool bird in Gisborne Airport. \n\nIt loves to eat fava although it will scoff nearly anything.\n\nMisael is a Sagittarius with a blood type of Wizard who likes sailors and cereals. However, Misael avoids gyms. By day, Misael is a simple Shop Fitter. By night, it enjoys Handball. \n\nMisael’s secret is that it looks at cat pictures on the internet. It has a hat that collects tiny skulls. The hat’s name is Elmer. \n",
