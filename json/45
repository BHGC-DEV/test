  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Kirsten’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Kirsten H Constance, but everyone calls it Kirsten. She is the most wrong bird in Wadestown. \n\nIt loves to eat cranberry-orange although it will get stuck into nearly anything.\n\nKirsten is a Gemini with a blood type of Useful who loves bacons and bites. However, Kirsten scorns swordfishes. By day, Kirsten is a simple Recovery Vehicle Coordinator. By night, she enjoys Netball. \n\nKirsten’s secret is that she spreads disinformation. She has a hat that votes Right. The hat’s name is Murphy. \n",
