  "name": "Winston",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Winston’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Winston Q Leola, but everyone calls it Winston. It is the most unfinished bird in Taharua. \n\nIt loves to eat kale although it will demolish nearly anything.\n\nWinston is a Leo with a blood type of Wizard who appreciates celeries and machines. However, Winston eschews eggs. By day, Winston is a simple Hotel Worker. By night, it enjoys Cycling. \n\nWinston’s secret is that it beats. It has a hat that contains multitudes. The hat’s name is Robert. \n",
