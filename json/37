  "name": "Waylon",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Waylon’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Waylon A Watson, but everyone calls it Waylon. He is the most gummy bird in Onekawa West. \n\nIt loves to eat spinach although it will tuck into nearly anything.\n\nWaylon is a Leo with a blood type of O+ who freaks out about swamps and mouths. However, Waylon detests helicopters. By day, Waylon is a simple Plant Operator. By night, he enjoys Machining. \n\nWaylon’s secret is that he kills houseplants through neglect. He has a hat that believes in false gods. The hat’s name is Zada. \n",
