  "name": "Kael",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Kael’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Kael Z Harris, but everyone calls it Kael. It is the most pastel bird in Glenduan. \n\nIt loves to eat elderberries although it will chow down nearly anything.\n\nKael is a Sagittarius with a blood type of Elf who appreciates foots and games. However, Kael deplores desks. By day, Kael is a simple Ice Cream Vendor. By night, it enjoys Driving. \n\nKael’s secret is that it spends far too much time and energy on a simple joke. It has a hat that has no clout. The hat’s name is Virginia. \n",
