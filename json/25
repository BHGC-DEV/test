  "name": "Houston",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Houston’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Houston M Elena, but everyone calls it Houston. It is the most excitable bird in Great Barrier Island. \n\nIt loves to eat rutabagas although it will swallow nearly anything.\n\nHouston is a Libra with a blood type of Elf who rejoices in textbooks and sausages. However, Houston antipathizes wishes. By day, Houston is a simple Sportswoman. By night, it enjoys Ghost hunting. \n\nHouston’s secret is that it is stanky. It has a hat that stans too hard. The hat’s name is Berneice. \n",
