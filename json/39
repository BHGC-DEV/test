  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Gwendolyn’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Gwendolyn K Jonathan, but everyone calls it Gwendolyn. It is the most bogus bird in Kaitaia East. \n\nIt loves to eat sprouts although it will nom nearly anything.\n\nGwendolyn is a Leo with a blood type of A+ who loves crabs and turnips. However, Gwendolyn is averse to dolls. By day, Gwendolyn is a simple Publican. By night, it enjoys Photography. \n\nGwendolyn’s secret is that it yawns bigly. It has a hat that yeets. The hat’s name is Delmar. \n",
