  "name": "Adriel",
  "description": "This bird is called Adriel. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Adriel L Alfred, but its best friends call it by its carefree nickname, Pate. It is the most feminine bird in Hillsborough West. \n\nAdriel loves to eat punch, although it will devour nearly anything that it considers sufficiently vibrant. \n\nAdriel is a Ophiuchus with a blood type of A-, who fancies questions and thrones. However, Adriel deplores colleges. By day, Adriel works as a simple polisher. By night, it enjoys origami. \n\nAdriel’s secret is that it looks deep within the souls of others and sees the agony within. It has a hat that recommends obscure music. The hat’s name is Eldridge.",
