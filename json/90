  "name": "Arjun",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Arjun’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Arjun Y Evans, but everyone calls it Arjun. It is the most precious bird in Hampstead. \n\nIt loves to eat basil although it will consume nearly anything.\n\nArjun is a Taurus with a blood type of AB+ who delights in haircuts and balls. However, Arjun eschews seeds. By day, Arjun is a simple Pipe Insulator. By night, it enjoys Photography. \n\nArjun’s secret is that it has an appetite for creation. It has a hat that went to the levy but the levy was dry. The hat’s name is Annie. \n",
