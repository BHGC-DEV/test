  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Evelyn’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Evelyn I Jake, but everyone calls it Evelyn. It is the most short bird in Wyndham. \n\nIt loves to eat olive although it will destroy nearly anything.\n\nEvelyn is a Pisces with a blood type of Choleric who enjoys mouths and groups. However, Evelyn disapproves of beaches. By day, Evelyn is a simple Catering Manager. By night, it enjoys Mycology. \n\nEvelyn’s secret is that it looks at cat pictures on the internet. It has a hat that is the chad of all chads. The hat’s name is Kelley. \n",
