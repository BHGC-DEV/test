  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Martin’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Martin V Carmen, but everyone calls it Martin. It is the most buttery bird in Oroua Downs-Waitohi. \n\nIt loves to eat quarters although it will annihilate nearly anything.\n\nMartin is a Libra with a blood type of Phlegmatic who fancies cats and feasts. However, Martin disesteems packets. By day, Martin is a simple Beauty Therapist. By night, it enjoys Cosplaying. \n\nMartin’s secret is that it secretly aspires to become a surgeon. It has a hat that grants additional brainpower. The hat’s name is Ollie. \n",
