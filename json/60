  "name": "Samantha",
  "description": "This bird is called Samantha. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Samantha I Wilber, but its best friends call it by its starry nickname, Kait. It is the most heavy bird in Aviemore. \n\nSamantha loves to eat hydrolyzed cats, although it will nibble nearly anything that it considers sufficiently solid. \n\nSamantha is a Gemini with a blood type of A+, who fancies trains and willows. However, Samantha loathes eagles. By day, Samantha works as a simple welfare officer. By night, it enjoys pet. \n\nSamantha’s secret is that it can roll into a ball. It has a hat that talks about D&D. The hat’s name is Sandy.",
