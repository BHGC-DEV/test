  "name": "Angeline",
  "description": "This bird is called Angeline. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Angeline H Amelia, but its best friends call it by its improbable nickname, Kim. It is the most celebrated bird in Island Bay West. \n\nAngeline loves to eat punch, although it will chew nearly anything that it considers sufficiently striking. \n\nAngeline is a Sagittarius with a blood type of AB-, who relishes notebooks and pairs. However, Angeline antipathizes plots. By day, Angeline works as a simple travel guide writer. By night, it enjoys mountain biking. \n\nAngeline’s secret is that it mixes up their, there, and they're . It has a hat that fixes dyslexia for all people within a square mile. The hat’s name is Lacy.",
