  "name": "Darnell",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Darnell’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Darnell U Luis, but everyone calls it Darnell. It is the most favorite bird in Tahuna Hills. \n\nIt loves to eat prepared although it will polish off nearly anything.\n\nDarnell is a Aquarius with a blood type of Yaas who rejoices in juices and kicks. However, Darnell deplores storms. By day, Darnell is a simple Travel Clerk. By night, it enjoys Horseback riding. \n\nDarnell’s secret is that it only has correct opinions. It has a hat that calls cats \"Fur Chickens\". The hat’s name is Donald. \n",
