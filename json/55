  "name": "Taliyah",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Taliyah’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Taliyah K Hannah, but everyone calls it Taliyah. It is the most oblong bird in Huntly East. \n\nIt loves to eat quail although it will make short work of nearly anything.\n\nTaliyah is a Scorpio with a blood type of Dark Red who loves staircases and fans. However, Taliyah disesteems ducklings. By day, Taliyah is a simple Legal Secretary. By night, it enjoys Inline skating. \n\nTaliyah’s secret is that it can moo. It has a hat that kills houseplants through neglect. The hat’s name is Louvenia. \n",
