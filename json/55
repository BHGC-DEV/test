  "name": "Desiree",
  "description": "This bird is called Desiree. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Desiree U Susanna, but its best friends call it by its upset nickname, Hannah. It is the most excitable bird in Brockville. \n\nDesiree loves to eat wocas, although it will snack nearly anything that it considers sufficiently winged. \n\nDesiree is a Pisces with a blood type of Yaas, who adores prisons and wrinkles. However, Desiree eschews drills. By day, Desiree works as a simple smallholder. By night, it enjoys taxidermy. \n\nDesiree’s secret is that it can't tell the difference between its and it's. It has a hat that roams the house at night in search of flesh. The hat’s name is Sue.",
