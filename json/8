  "name": "Alannah",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Alannah’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Alannah R Lindsey, but everyone calls it Alannah. It is the most worn bird in Masterton Railway. \n\nIt loves to eat foie although it will polish off nearly anything.\n\nAlannah is a Taurus with a blood type of Savvy who fancies chocolates and pedestrians. However, Alannah objects to breaks. By day, Alannah is a simple Antique Dealer. By night, it enjoys Vehicle restoration. \n\nAlannah’s secret is that it is stanky. It has a hat that causes excessive biting. The hat’s name is Gwendolyn. \n",
