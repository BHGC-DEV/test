  "name": "Skyler",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Skyler’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Skyler O Anna, but everyone calls it Skyler. He is the most inconsequential bird in Ocean View. \n\nIt loves to eat hominy although it will gobble nearly anything.\n\nSkyler is a Aries with a blood type of O- who loves thumbs and forests. However, Skyler avoids lizards. By day, Skyler is a simple Hospital Worker. By night, he enjoys Soapmaking. \n\nSkyler’s secret is that he has multiple sockpuppet accounts. He has a hat that is an enlightened centrist. The hat’s name is Earnest. \n",
