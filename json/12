  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Kade’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Kade V Nannie, but everyone calls it Kade. It is the most unlucky bird in Otorohanga Rural East. \n\nIt loves to eat toddlers although it will tuck into nearly anything.\n\nKade is a Leo with a blood type of Useful who fancies yards and caterpillars. However, Kade avoids coffees. By day, Kade is a simple Upholsterer. By night, it enjoys Cooking. \n\nKade’s secret is that it wishes it was a mole. It has a hat that slacks off during video meetings. The hat’s name is Charlotte. \n",
