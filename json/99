  "name": "Dakota",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Dakota’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Dakota T Newton, but everyone calls it Dakota. It is the most considerate bird in Paihia. \n\nIt loves to eat guinea although it will shovel down nearly anything.\n\nDakota is a Virgo with a blood type of Choleric who relishes answers and cements. However, Dakota deplores fairies. By day, Dakota is a simple Radio Engineer. By night, it enjoys Fashion. \n\nDakota’s secret is that it can spell Kwisatz Haderach without needing to look it up. It has a hat that is made of skin. The hat’s name is Lucile. \n",
