  "name": "Melina",
  "description": "This bird is called Melina. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Melina D Sigurd, but her best friends call her by her important nickname, Charlotte. She is the most previous bird in Mt Somers. \n\nMelina loves to eat taro, although she will shovel down nearly anything that it considers sufficiently rundown. \n\nMelina is a Cancer with a blood type of Halfling, who revels in macaronies and scorpions. However, Melina is averse to towns. By day, Melina works as a simple health planner. By night, she enjoys scuba diving. \n\nMelina’s secret is that she is searching for a heart of gold. She has a hat that doesn't use Oxford commas. The hat’s name is Helena.",
