  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Javon’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Javon C Flora, but everyone calls it Javon. It is the most vain bird in Amisfield. \n\nIt loves to eat fruit although it will chaw nearly anything.\n\nJavon is a Scorpio with a blood type of K who delights in hats and dreams. However, Javon shuns hairs. By day, Javon is a simple Stocktaker. By night, it enjoys Fashion. \n\nJavon’s secret is that it is a motherflippin' wizard. It has a hat that will fight you. The hat’s name is Leonie. \n",
