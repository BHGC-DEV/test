  "name": "Bryson",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Bryson’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Bryson B Houston, but everyone calls it Bryson. It is the most tiny bird in Mangawhai. \n\nIt loves to eat thuringer although it will destroy nearly anything.\n\nBryson is a Leo with a blood type of Biff who delights in jars and vests. However, Bryson loathes snails. By day, Bryson is a simple Repairer. By night, it enjoys Yo-yoing. \n\nBryson’s secret is that it doesn't stop, never gives up, holds its head high and reaches the top. It has a hat that fades out, again. The hat’s name is Bertie. \n",
