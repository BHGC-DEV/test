  "name": "Rose",
  "description": "This bird is called Rose. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Rose M Fairy, but its best friends call it by its adept nickname, Barby. It is the most wiggly bird in Woburn North. \n\nRose loves to eat dessert, although it will destroy nearly anything that it considers sufficiently angry. \n\nRose is a Aquarius with a blood type of Wizard, who enjoys bays and prices. However, Rose avoids bushes. By day, Rose works as a simple travel consultant. By night, it enjoys knitting. \n\nRose’s secret is that it longs for the ocean. It has a hat that thinks monkey JPGs are worth actual money. The hat’s name is Fay.",
