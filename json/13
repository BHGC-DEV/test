  "name": "Joanna",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Joanna’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Joanna I Gertha, but everyone calls it Joanna. She is the most babyish bird in St Martins. \n\nIt loves to eat shoots although it will nibble nearly anything.\n\nJoanna is a Gemini with a blood type of Phlegmatic who adores snows and sandwiches. However, Joanna disesteems gases. By day, Joanna is a simple Pathologist. By night, she enjoys Worldbuilding. \n\nJoanna’s secret is that she has too many kinks. She has a hat that is the living avatar of Disappointment. The hat’s name is Betty. \n",
