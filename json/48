  "name": "Demarion",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Demarion’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Demarion V Oris, but everyone calls it Demarion. It is the most knowledgeable bird in Kennedys Bush. \n\nIt loves to eat bison although it will snack nearly anything.\n\nDemarion is a Taurus with a blood type of B+ who revels in sailboats and snowmen. However, Demarion despises beats. By day, Demarion is a simple Meat Inspector. By night, it enjoys LARPing. \n\nDemarion’s secret is that it can sing, but only songs you hate. It has a hat that knows why purple is. The hat’s name is Alvera. \n",
