  "name": "Todd",
  "description": "This bird is called Todd. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Todd W Marcella, but its best friends call it by its amusing nickname, Suzie. It is the most strident bird in Orana Park. \n\nTodd loves to eat amaranth, although it will chew nearly anything that it considers sufficiently decent. \n\nTodd is a Scorpio with a blood type of O+, who revels in wedges and owls. However, Todd scorns straws. By day, Todd works as a simple art historian. By night, it enjoys role-playing games. \n\nTodd’s secret is that it has too many kinks. It has a hat that longs for the skies. The hat’s name is Louvenia.",
