  "name": "Henry",
  "description": "This bird is called Henry. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Henry Y Myrtis, but its best friends call it by its actual nickname, Riche. It is the most idealistic bird in Broad Bay-Portobello. \n\nHenry loves to eat fat, although it will obliterate nearly anything that it considers sufficiently lanky. \n\nHenry is a Taurus with a blood type of Dark Red, who loves hurricanes and thrones. However, Henry detests bulldozers. By day, Henry works as a simple counsellor. By night, it enjoys machining. \n\nHenry’s secret is that it plays guitar, poorly. It has a hat that has the second personality of a ruthless bully. The hat’s name is Moses.",
