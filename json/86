  "name": "Sergio",
  "description": "This bird is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. This is Sergio’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Sergio H Kirk, but everyone calls it Sergio. It is the most bumpy bird in Raupunga. \n\nIt loves to eat flour although it will shovel down nearly anything.\n\nSergio is a Cancer with a blood type of Retiring who delights in plates and kitchens. However, Sergio eschews camels. By day, Sergio is a simple Bus Valeter. By night, it enjoys BASE jumping. \n\nSergio’s secret is that it slacks off during video meetings. It has a hat that causes excessive yawning. The hat’s name is Joan. \n",
