This is Luciano’s. \n\nThis bird's full name is Luciano [ Roscoe, but everyone calls it Luciano. It is the most helpful bird in Rangipo. \n\nIt loves to eat chocolate although it will eat nearly anything.\n\nLuciano is a Gemini with a blood type of Melancholic who likes pimples and clocks. However, Luciano avoids signs. By day, Luciano is a simple Tour Guide. By night, it enjoys Quilting. \n\nLuciano’s secret is that it is stronger than the foundations of the earth. It has a hat that is the living avatar of Bonk. The hat’s name is Maymie. \n",
