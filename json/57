  "name": "Richard",
  "description": "This bird is called Richard. It is part of the Bird Hat Grift Club, a collection of utterly unique, randomly generated birds (with hats.) Every bird has its own story. \n\nThis bird's full name is Richard R Ernesto, but its best friends call it by its gorgeous nickname, Elbert. It is the most closed bird in Governors Bay. \n\nRichard loves to eat puree, although it will ingurgitate nearly anything that it considers sufficiently this. \n\nRichard is a Scorpio with a blood type of A+, who adores hamsters and instruments. However, Richard abhors women. By day, Richard works as a simple storeman. By night, it enjoys water sports. \n\nRichard’s secret is that it wishes it was a mole. It has a hat that believes in false gods. The hat’s name is Isabel.",
